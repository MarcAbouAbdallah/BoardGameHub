## Welcome to group 5's project: Board Game Hub.
This application is a social network for all board game lovers. Players and game owners can unite here to connect, share their games and organize events. Below are deliverable descriptions and tables listing the team members, roles and task breakdown per deliverable. Feel free to browse the repository [wiki](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki) for more information on the project.\

**Jerome Courtemanche**\
Jerome is a second year computer engineering student. His interest in computers and software started at a young age with video games. Curiosity made his passion evolve to processors and other chips. Although he is mainly interested in working with hardware, he enjoys writing software as well.

**Bora Denizasan**\
Bora is a second year computer engineering student. From an early age, robots piqued his interest. Similarly, robotics is his area of interest. In his spare time, He enjoys playing overlooked video games to relax.

**Mubeen Mohammed**\
Mubeen is a third year engineering student. His interest in AI applications and machine learning. In his free time, he enjoys playing chess and building cool stuff and automating them

**Raphaël Verger**\
Raphaël is a third year computer engineering student. He is mainly focused on machine learning, data analysis and software development. Outside of the classroom, he enjoys traveling and taking pictures!

### Deliverable 1
The scope of this deliverable contained the modelling and database setup for the semester's project. First we had to create a requirements model for the application comprising 12 funcional requirements and 3 non-functional requirements. We moved on to use cases for the next part of the requirement model. We started by making two [use case diagrams](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki/Use-Case-Diagrams) describing how users can interact with the application. We finished our requirement model by creating a detailed description for [7 of the most important use cases](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki/Use-Cases) for our diagrams. The second part of the project was the [exploratory domain model](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki/Class-Diagram). We created a class diagram that reflects the interactions between different parts of the program. The third part was the code implementation along with the persistence layer. We created the code which corresponds to the domain model and connected it to our persistence layer through Spring & Hibernate. We did all this while properly applying and documenting the engineering design process we went through. Whether it is [meeting minutes](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki/Meeting-minutes) or [design decisions](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki/Project-Report), every step of our journey is documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki). Information on our roles and division of tasks can be found in the table below.\
