## Welcome to group 5's project: Board Game Hub.
This application is a social network for all board game lovers. Players and game owners can unite here to connect, share their games and organize events. Below are deliverable descriptions and tables listing the team members, roles and task breakdown per deliverable. Feel free to browse the repository [wiki](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki) for more information on the project.\

Here is a short introduction to the members of group 5 who are working on this project:

**Marc Abou Abdallah**\
Marc is a third-year software engineering student with an interest in software development and AI. His personal hobbies include soccer, going to the gym, and working out.

**Deon Aftahi**\
Deon is a second-year Software Engineering student with a strong interest in full-stack development and entrepeneurship. He enjoys building seamless and interactive applications from the ground up. Outside of academics, he spends his time working out, traveling, and playing guitar.

**Marleine Atalla**\
Marleine is a third year Computer Engineering student. Some of her interests include Robotics, Automation, and Artificial Intelligence. Beyond the classroom setting, she enjoys running and traveling. 

**Jerome Courtemanche**\
Jerome is a second year computer engineering student. His interest in computers and software started at a young age with video games. Curiosity made his passion evolve to processors and other chips. Although he is mainly interested in working with hardware, he enjoys writing software as well.

**Bora Denizasan**\
Bora is a second year computer engineering student. From an early age, robots piqued his interest. Similarly, robotics is his area of interest. In his spare time, He enjoys playing overlooked video games to relax.

**Mubeen Mohammed**\
Mubeen is a third year software engineering student. His interest in AI applications and machine learning. In his free time, he enjoys playing chess and building cool stuff and automating them

**Raphaël Verger**\
Raphaël is a third year computer engineering student. He is mainly focused on machine learning, data analysis and software development. Outside of the classroom, he enjoys traveling and taking pictures!

### Deliverable 1
The scope of this deliverable included modelling and database setup for the semester project. First, we created a [requirements model](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki/Requirements) for the application, defining 12 functional and 3 non-functional requirements. Next, we worked on use cases, providing two [use case diagrams](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki/Use-Case-Diagrams) and a detailed description of [7 key use cases](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki/Use-Cases) from our diagrams.
The second part of the project was focused on the [exploratory domain model](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki/Class-Diagram), where we created a class diagram to represent the interactions in the application.
In the third phase of the deliverable, we implemented the model classes along with the persistence layer. We also conducted thorough [testing of our persistence layer](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki/Testing-Documentation) using JUnit.
Throughout the entire process, we carefully applied and documented our software engineering design process. Whether through [meeting minutes](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki/Meeting-minutes) or [design decisions](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki/Project-Report), every step of our journey is recorded in the [wiki](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2025/Group-5/wiki). 
Information regarding team roles and task distribution can be found in the table below.\

**Overview table:**
Note: Some tasks are missing from the table because they were done by everyone in collaboration during team meetings, including:
* Requirements
* Use case diagrams
* Domain model\
Coding and documentation tasks were split as outlined in the table below.
